# RL Crash Course

Welcome to the RL Crash Course, a concise introduction to key concepts in Reinforcement Learning (RL). This course covers fundamental RL algorithms, from value-based methods to policy optimization techniques.

You’ll explore:

1. Q Learning and Deep Q Networks (DQN) – Learning optimal policies using value iteration and deep neural networks.
2. Policy Gradient Methods – Directly optimizing policies for continuous and discrete action spaces.
3. Actor-Critic Architectures – Combining value-based and policy-based methods for more stable learning.
4. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) – A widely used on-policy optimization method balancing exploration and exploitation.
5. GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization) – A reinforcement learning method originally designed for LLM.

The chapters are,

- [Q Learning and DQN](01.md)
- [Policy Gradient](02.md)
- [Actor-Critic](03.md)
- [PPO](04.md)
- [GRPO](05.md)
